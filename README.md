## üìñ Overview
This repository contains my **Final Year Project 2 (FYP2)** at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), focusing on **GPU parallelization** of the [Classic McEliece](https://classic.mceliece.org/) post-quantum cryptosystem using **CUDA**.

The goal was to accelerate **encryption, decryption, encapsulation, and decapsulation** by offloading computationally intensive tasks (syndrome generation, error vector formation, FFT, Benes network, etc.) to NVIDIA GPUs.  
Performance was benchmarked and compared with an optimised CPU vectorized implementation, showing **significant throughput improvements**.

## ‚ú® Features
- ‚úÖ **Full KEM flow:** Encapsulation, Decapsulation, Encryption, Decryption  
- ‚úÖ **CUDA kernels** for FFT, Benes network, error vector generation  
- ‚úÖ **Benchmarking scripts** ‚Äì CPU vs GPU, multiple `num_blocks` configurations  
- ‚úÖ **CSV output** for results & plotting  
- ‚úÖ **Full FYP2 Report** (PDF) included  

## üñ•Ô∏è Tested Environment
| Component | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS |
| GPU | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 (4 GB) |
| CUDA Toolkit | 12.4 |
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 5 3550H @ 2.10 GHz |
| RAM | 12 GB |
| Driver Version | 550.144.03 |

## üìä Key Results (Throughput in Bytes/Second)
Here‚Äôs a highlight of the performance improvement:

**Encrypt:**
| Num Blocks | CPU Encrypt (B/s) | GPU Encrypt (B/s) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 10,917,018 | 2,314,525 |
| 2 | 13,532,555 | 4,791,434 |
| 4 | 12,782,441 | 9,871,298 |
| 8 | 12,806,684 | 20,305,654 |
| 16 | 12,542,706 | 41,614,452 |
| 32 | **12,219,651** | **81,403,555** |

**Decrypt:**
| Num Blocks | CPU Decrypt (B/s) | GPU Decrypt (B/s) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 2,515,560 | 553,932 |
| 2 | 2,542,354 | 1,165,266 |
| 4 | 2,517,718 | 2,303,712 |
| 8 | 2,488,658 | 4,657,335 |
| 16 | 2,418,709 | 9,264,162 |
| 32 | **2,508,264** | **18,515,560** |

üìà **Observation:**  
- CPU throughput stays almost constant ‚Äî no parallelism (loops run sequentially).  
- GPU throughput rises almost linearly with `num_blocks`, showing strong scaling thanks to parallel execution.
- At 32 blocks, GPU achieves **6.7√ó faster encryption** and **7.4√ó faster decryption** compared to CPU.
